  Below are the packages that are necessary to run React on the client-side.
  First, we are linking to React.js, but in recent versions, the DOM functionality
  of React has been separated into a seperate library, which we link to with react-dom

  Finally, we also include the babel standalone package. Babel is a transpiler, allowing
  us to utilize ES6 syntax, and babel will compile this into more browser compatible
  ES5 code.

  Below we are going to go over some of our React fundamentals and common methods.

    When rendering React elements to the DOM, you want to have some pre-existing
    div available. Here I am making a simple container div for our React elements
    to render to.

  <div id="container">

  </div>

  <!--
    Now, below is our React code. We are wrapping this in a script tag, and specifying
    that the type is "text/babel", so that the babel script knows what to transpile.

    Don't worry about ES6 syntax differences right now. That is something we will come to
    later, and for now it won't look very different at all.

    Below is an example of a simple component. We have boxes.
    There are a lot of different kinds of boxes, but they all share some similar
    characteristics. Maybe the share styling, but have different names on them.

    Basic structure:

    function ComponentName(props){
      return(stuff);
    }

    Remember, props are how you pass information into your components. You can pass
    whatever you want in, but they have to behave the same way once they are there.

      help with organization, and there are also some quirks in React that cause errors
      when you render without wrapping divs.

      of that variable into the text prop. You can pass variables in JSX using {}

      ReactDOM.render() is the method, part of react-dom, that allows us to apply what we have
      written in React to an element in the already existing DOM. It's worth reading more
      about the "virtual dom" in React.
